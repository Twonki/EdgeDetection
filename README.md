# EdgeDetection
For the Course AVBildMed

This Repository covers my seminartopic "Edge Detection" for the Course of "Auswertung und Visualisierung medizinischer Bilddaten" at the TH NÃ¼rnberg Ohm. 
It contains both the slideshow as github slides, aswell as either the code for some edge detection, or the paper (to be determined)
